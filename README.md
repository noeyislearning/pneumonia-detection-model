# pneumonia-detection-model
This repository contains code and a trained Keras model for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using TensorFlow. The model was trained on a dataset of chest X-rays from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset. It can be used to classify chest X-rays as either pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative.
